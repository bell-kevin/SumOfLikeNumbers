# SumOfLikeNumbers
In this project, the user inputs a number, and if the number is even, the program calculates the total of all the even numbers up to and including the user’s input, and if the number is odd, the program calculates the total of all the odd numbers up to and including the user’s input. For example, if the user entered the number 10, the program determines that this is an even number and adds up the even numbers from 0 to 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), for a result of 30. If the user entered the number 9, the program determines that this is an odd number and adds up the odd numbers from 0 to 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), for a result of 25. The output must include the description of the numbers – even or odd. 

The program can use ONLY ONE For loop, not one for even numbers and a different one for odd numbers.  

Run the program 4 times, twice with even numbers and twice with odd numbers, and take screenshots of the results. 

Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.  

Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine.
