# SumOfLikeNumbers
The user inputs a number, and if the number is even, the program calculates the total of all the even numbers up to and including the user’s input, and if the number is odd, the program calculates the total of all the odd numbers up to and including the user’s input. For example, if the user entered the number 10, the program determines that this is an even number and adds up the even numbers from 0 to 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), for a result of 30. If the user entered the number 9, the program determines that this is an odd number and adds up the odd numbers from 0 to 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), for a result of 25. The output must include the description of the numbers – even or odd. 

The program can use ONLY ONE For loop, not one for even numbers and a different one for odd numbers.  

Run the program 4 times, twice with even numbers and twice with odd numbers, and take screenshots of the results. 

Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.  

Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
